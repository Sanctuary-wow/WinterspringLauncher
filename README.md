# Winterspring Launcher
Allows you to play on [Sanctuarywow.com](https://sanctuarywow.com/) with modern 1.14 WoW Client!
This is the fork of the [original Winterspring launcher](https://github.com/0blu/WinterspringLauncher/). It has been adjusted to default to Sanctuary and applies fixes.

## Easy setup
The launcher will do everything for you.  
It will download the 1.14 client, setup HermesProxy and launch the game.  
When HermesProxy has an update it is automatically applied.

## Addons
Most addons for 1.14.0 should work.  
You can download older versions from CurseForge under the "Files" tab. ([Example](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie/files/all?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A9094))

## Why?
The modern WoW-Classic client provides many improvements in hardware compatibility and accessibility.

The launcher will make the classic client accessible to everyone.  
So if you find any bugs [please report them](https://github.com/WowLegacyCore/HermesProxy/issues/new/choose).  
(If you find any bugs associated to the launcher report them [here](https://github.com/Sanctuary-wow/WinterspringLauncher/issues))

## Is this allowed?
Currently HermesProxy is tolerated on Sanctuary.  
⚠️You **will** get suspended if you exploit any game breaking bugs.  
So far no-one has been banned for using official HermesProxy.  
Just use common sense and <u>**play fair**</u>!

# Many thanks to
